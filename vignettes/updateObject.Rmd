# Introduction

`r Biocpkg("updateObject")` is an R package that provides a set of
tools built around the `updateObject()` generic function to make it
easy to work with old serialized S4 instances.
The package is primarily useful to package maintainers who want to
update the serialized S4 instances included in their package.
